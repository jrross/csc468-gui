  <h1>CSS Modifications</h1>
  <p>All CSS modifications are handled in lib/style.css. This file handles all
     of the pages for the project. The required changes in CSS can be seen in
     the grey background in all of the pages, the black headers as seen above,
     and the change in span can be seen on the main page next to "Current note"
     and "Current length", the text here will appear yellow. Additionally the 
     navigation bar is styled as the black bar accross the top.</p>
  <h1>Application Use</h1>
  <h3>Main Page</h3>
  <p>The top row of buttons are used to change which note is to be added next,
     pressing one of these buttons will assign the current note (displayed
	 lower on the page) to be the pitch of the corresponding button. The note
	 length box can be filled in to indicate what length of note (in seconds)
	 the note should play for. Upon pressing the "Set" button, the current
	 length will be set to the value contained in the note length box. Confirm
	 note will take the values within current note, and current length, and put
	 them on the bars below as the most recent note in the sequence. The undo
	 button will undo the most recent action taken and continue down the most
	 recent actions with repetitive clicks. Pressing the redo button will do
	 the opposite and redo the most recent actions. However the list of redo
	 actions will be cut off and restarted upon adding a new action. Supported
	 actions for undo/redo are adding a new note to the bars below, changing
	 the current note, and changing the current length. The save button will
	 save the entire song to a file that can be accessed from the file page.
	 Upon pressing it, a prompt will show to take the name of the file to save
	 as. If cancel is hit or the name is blank, it will not save. Play will
	 play the entire sequence of notes as depicted below on the bars.</p>
  <h3>File Page</h3>
  <p>This page will display all the files that are available to be used. Files
     are to be made on the mainpage, when saved they will be stored here. There
	 is no limit to the number of files which can be used. Each file as displayed
	 on the page has 3 actions that can be used. Load will take the file, and load
	 its contents and take it back over to the main page, with all of the
	 notes loaded and available. However, when loading a file, undo will not 
	 be available for any of the notes that were loaded in, only notes added
	 thereafter. The download button will download the song in a file format
	 which can be used later. The X option will delete the file from the server,
	 this action is irreversable. The upload option will allow the user to upload
	 a file containing a song that is not on the server to the list of songs on
	 the page. Note: a file must be chosen before using the upload button. Only
	 files in the format as downloaded will be able to be correctly played.</p>
  <h1>Application Limitations</h1>
  <p>All the expected functionality is working properly. Limitations in the
     usage of the application will come from any invalid input. Most of the 
	 functionality expects valid input and doesn't check for invalid input.
	 The places where these issues will show up are in the note length field
	 on the main page, where it does no checking to ensure that the entry is
	 a number between 0.1 and 5, inputting any information outside of this
	 may cause issues. The confirm note button on the main page also does no
	 checking in the current implementation, so it must be ensured that both
	 note and length are entered, it will accept them even if they are not
	 populated. The upload functionality on the Files tab does no checking to
	 ensure that the file is a valid format, so it must be ensured that any
	 file uploaded is a valid file format (as produced by the site).</p>
  <h1>Extensions</h1>
  <h3>1.a. Show a note on a music bar line image instead of the letter</h3>
  <p>This is done on the main page. The music bar line is dynamic and adjusts
     as the length of the song increases, although it will stick to a preset
	 length in the case it is below a set threshhold. This works with the undo
	 redo pattern. Testing for this can be done by placing each note and ensuring
	 it goes in the desired location. A full range.txt is included under the files
     tab with this test already written and ready. Additionally other tests can be
	 performed to ensure that longer songs are still accurately represented once
	 going past the preset threshhold length.</p>
  <h3>1.b. Show a note image relating the length of the sound</h3>
  <p>This takes the previous step a bit further. The horizontal lengths of the notes
     depict how long the note is played for, the longer it is played for, the longer
	 the rectangle. This can be tested by putting in varying length notes and checking
	 visually that longer length notes are longer than shorter length notes. An example
	 length test.txt file is available to showcase this feature.</p>
  <h3>1.c. Style the buttons</h3>
  <p>All buttons in the entire project have the same style applied to them. There are
     no real tests for this, other than to visually verify the buttons are styled.
	 buttons are a dark grey with white text, and turn black when hovered.</p>
  <h3>1.d. Show the notes being played, as the song is played</h3>
  <p>While a note is playing, its note corresponding note on the bar will be colored
     yellow while it plays. The note returns to black when it is finished playing.
	 This can be tested using entire songs to ensure the proper notes change colors at
	 the proper times. Any of the provided files already on the site can be used to
	 verify this. full range.txt to verify it works for various pitches, and length 
	 test.txt can be used to verify it works properly with varying length notes.</p>
